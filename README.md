# Data - Report week 1

A computer program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.
* **input** - Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
* **output** - Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
* **assignment** - Set the value of a storage location denoted by a variable name.
* **math and logic** - Perform basic mathematical operations like addition, and multiplication, and logical operations like and, or, and not.
* **conditional execution** - Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.
* **repetition** - Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
* **Debugging** – removing Bugs -  Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime errors, and semantic errors.

## **Data types**

### **Numeric**

#### **Integer**

1 2 3 4 -1 -2 -3 -4…..  
This value is represented by **int class**. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal). In Python there is no limit to how long an interger value can be.

#### **Float**

1,3  1,4  1,6  5,4   6,4   -3,4  -4,3   
This value is represented by **float class**. It is a real number with floating point representation. It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or negative integer may be appended to specify scientific notation.

### **Boolean**

This is a value that expresses a truth value (which can be **either true or false**) 

### **Sequential**

#### **List**

### **String**

A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote.

**Some of the most common string methods:**
* s.lower(), s.upper() — returns the lowercase or uppercase version of the string  
* s.strip() — returns a string with whitespace removed from the start and end  
* s.isalpha()/s.isdigit()/s.isspace()… — tests if all the string chars are in the various character classes  
* s.startswith(‘ai’), s.endswith(‘ai’) — tests if the string starts or ends with the given ai strin  
* s.find(‘other’) — searches for the given other string (not a regular expression) within s, and returns the first index where it begins or -1 if not found  
* s.replace(‘old’, ‘new’) — returns a string where all occurrences of ‘old’ have been replaced by ‘new’  
* s.split(‘delim’) — returns a list of substrings separated by the given delimiter. The delimiter is not a regular expression, it’s just text. ‘aaa,bbb,ccc’.split(‘,’) -> [‘aaa’, ‘bbb’, ‘ccc’].  
* s.join(list) — opposite of split(), joins the elements in the given list together using the string as the delimiter.
